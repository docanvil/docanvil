# DocAnvil

**Forge beautiful static documentation from Markdown.**

DocAnvil turns your Markdown files into a polished, searchable documentation site with a single command. Built in Rust for speed, designed for developers who want great docs without the setup overhead.

**[Documentation](https://docanvil.github.io/docanvil/)** &middot; **[GitHub](https://github.com/docanvil/docanvil)**

## Quickstart

```bash
cargo install docanvil
docanvil new my-docs
cd my-docs
docanvil serve
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — your site is live with hot reloading.

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
docanvil build
```

Static HTML goes to `dist/`, ready to host anywhere.

## Why DocAnvil?

Most documentation tools either look great but lock you in, or give you control but demand hours of configuration. DocAnvil gives you both — a site you'll be proud of out of the box, with the flexibility to make it your own.

- **Instant results** — scaffold, serve, and start writing in under a minute
- **Beautiful by default** — clean, readable design with dark mode, syntax highlighting, and responsive layout
- **Live reloading** — see every edit reflected instantly in your browser
- **Rich Markdown** — tabs, admonitions, code groups, diagrams, popovers, and wikilinks built in
- **Fully customisable** — themes, templates, and CSS variables let you match any brand
- **Static output** — deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, or anywhere that serves HTML
- **Fast** — Rust-powered builds that scale with your content
