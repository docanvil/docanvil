# Roadmap

DocAnvil follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Here's where things stand and where they're headed.

**Current version: 1.0.0**

---

### 1.1.x — Core Feature Enhancements

Localisation Support, Doc Versioning Support, PDF output format, Style Linting

### 1.2.x — Extensibility

WASM plugin system (v1), additional CLI flags, more diagnostics, and template enhancements. Fully backward compatible.

### 1.3.x+ — Ecosystem Growth

Plugin hooks, performance optimizations, incremental builds, caching, and a plugin SDK crate. Breaking changes require a major release.

---

## 2.0 and Beyond

A 2.0 release would only happen if there's a clear need — configuration redesign, plugin API v2, fundamental output model changes, or major architectural shifts. It should be deliberate and well-justified.
